# YSP2019-Python-Final-Project
Repository for the SpellCheck final project in YSP Python 2019:

  SpellCheck is a program that aids in checking a text file for spelling errors as efficiently as possible, and recommends similar words to those misspelled. It facilitates multiple languages and unicode characters, which can be chosen by the user. It allows users to upload certain file types for spell checking from their computer. After running, the program will produce a text file containing each misspelled word on a line, followed by the line number of misspelled words, and up to three suggestions for each word. 
  The user can also type words into the program that will be inserted into the dictionary, which will not be flagged as misspelled by the program (e.g. names, archaic words, etc), just like MS word and google spell checking programs. The program will also skip words that contain numbers, such as addresses and phone numbers, as well as words in all uppercase (also similar to MS word and google spell checking).
